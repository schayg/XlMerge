# XlMerge
This is based on infostreams/ExcelMerge. Heavily modified, to be able to include graphs and drawings in the excel files, and honor hidden sheets as well. It also will add a "prefix" to the original sheet names to separate the sheets originating from different files, but still preserve the original sheet name.
